# Member Berries Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension replaces all cases of Remember/remember with Member/member, and colorizes the text to a "Member Berry Purple".

*(NOTE: While using this extension, you may notice that the first R&zwnj;emember(s) got replaced by Member)*

This is still a WIP. The code is ugly, and probably not very performant.

# TODO

- [ ] Package for Chrome Extension Store
- [ ] Rewrite replaceText function to be quicker
- [ ] Figure out the most acurate "member berry purple"
